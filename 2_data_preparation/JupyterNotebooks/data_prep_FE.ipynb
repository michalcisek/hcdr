    "# Introduction: Home Credit Default Risk Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended for those who are new to machine learning competitions or want a gentle introduction to the problem. I purposely avoid jumping into complicated models or joining together lots of data in order to show the basics of how to get started in machine learning! Any comments or suggestions are much appreciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take an initial look at the Home Credit default risk machine learning competition currently hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Supervised__: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features\n",
    "* __Classification__: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided by [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net/about-us.aspx), a service dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. Predicting whether or not a client will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need, and Home Credit is hosting this competition on Kaggle to see what sort of models the machine learning community can develop to help them in this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 different sources of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* application_train/application_test: the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. \n",
    "* bureau: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits.\n",
    "* bureau_balance: monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. Each row is one month of a previous credit, and a single previous credit can have multiple rows, one for each month of the credit length. \n",
    "* previous_application: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n",
    "* POS_CASH_BALANCE: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows.\n",
    "* credit_card_balance: monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows.\n",
    "* installments_payment: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram shows how all of the data is related:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/home-credit/home_credit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we are provided with the definitions of all the columns (in `HomeCredit_columns_description.csv`) and an example of the expected submission file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will stick to using only the main application training and testing data. Although if we want to have any hope of seriously competing, we need to use all the data, for now we will stick to one file which should be more manageable. This will let us establish a baseline that we can then improve upon. With these projects, it's best to build up an understanding of the problem a little at a time rather than diving all the way in and getting completely lost! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric: ROC AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a grasp of the data (reading through the [column descriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data) helps immensely), we need to understand the metric by which our submission is judged. In this case, it is a common classification metric known as the [Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC, also sometimes called AUROC)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132777/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC AUC may sound intimidating, but it is relatively straightforward once you can get your head around the two individual concepts. The [Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) graphs the true positive rate versus the false positive rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](http://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ROC-curve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A single line on the graph indicates the curve for a single model, and movement along a line indicates changing the threshold used for classifying a positive instance. The threshold starts at 0 in the upper right to and goes to 1 in the lower left. A curve that is to the left and above another curve indicates a better model. For example, the blue model is better than the red model, which is better than the black diagonal line which indicates a naive random guessing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Area Under the Curve (AUC)](http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm) explains itself by its name! It is simply the area under the ROC curve. (This is the integral of the curve.) This metric is between 0 and 1 with a better model scoring higher. A model that simply guesses at random will have an ROC AUC of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we measure a classifier according to the ROC AUC, we do not generation 0 or 1 predictions, but rather a probability between 0 and 1. This may be confusing because we usually like to think in terms of accuracy, but when we get into problems with inbalanced classes (we will see this is the case), accuracy is not the best metric. For example, if I wanted to build a model that could detect terrorists with 99.9999% accuracy, I would simply make a model that predicted every single person was not a terrorist. Clearly, this would not be effective (the recall would be zero) and we use more advanced metrics such as ROC AUC or the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) to more accurately reflect the performance of a classifier. A model with a high ROC AUC will also have a high accuracy, but the [ROC AUC is a better representation of model performance.](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/806/advantages-of-auc-vs-standard-accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not that we know the background of the data we are using and the metric to maximize, let's get into exploring the data. In this notebook, as mentioned previously, we will stick to the main data sources and simple models which we can build upon in future work. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Follow-up Notebooks__\n",
    "\n",
    "For those looking to keep working on this problem, I have a series of follow-up notebooks:\n",

    "Kaggle competitions are won by feature engineering: those win are those who can create the most useful features out of the data.

This represents one of the patterns in machine learning: feature engineering has a greater return on investment than model building and hyperparameter tuning.

    "\n",
    "One simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. \n",

    "In the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py)).

In this frame of mind, we can make a couple features that attempt to capture what we think may be important for telling whether a client will default on a loan. Here I'm going to use five features that were inspired by [this script](https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features) by Aguiar:\n",
